# 5004: Credential Vulnerability Disclosure Template
- Authors: Dan Gisolfi, Daniel Hardman
- Status Date: 2019-09-01

*Sovrin prefers to engage with security researchers and ethical hackers about its credential technology using a [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) approach. If you become aware of a vulnerability in Sovrin's credential implementation, or in the practices or technologies used by an issuer or verifier of Sovrin credentials, please let us know by filling out the template below, and emailing it to [security@sovrin.org](mailto:security@sovrin.org). We will work with you to get it fixed.*

*Please frame your disclosure in terms from the [general threat model for verifiable credentials (Aries RFC 0207)](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0207-credential-fraud-threat-model/README.md). This will help us recognize common patterns in vulnerabilities.*

### User Story

*Describe your concern with a story that makes the potential for fraud or abuse obvious. Ideally, anyone who reads the story should be able to produce the situation where the vulnerability manifests. You can incorporate interaction diagrams if desired. For example:*

>Alice's bank requires proof of address, so Alice presents Bank with a credential containing address data. However, Bank doesn't recognize the DID of the issuer, and therefore is not confident that Alice's address was attested by someone trustworthy.

*The story should end with a problem statement that highlights the the potential abuse, such as:*

>My concern is that the [credential presentation protocol used by Sovrin (Aries 0037)](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/master/features/0037-present-proof/README.md) doesn't convey enough information about the issuer for the verifier to achieve confidence on this point.

### Fraud Dimensions

*Answer the 4 key questions outlined in [Aries RFC 0207](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/master/concepts/0207-credential-fraud-threat-model/README.md). For example:*

>1. Who is the perpetrator of the fraud? **fake-issuer**
>2. Who is directly deceived?  **fool-holder**
>3. When is the deception committed? **issuance-time**
>4. Where (on which fact) is the deception focused? **bad-issuer-identity**

### Assessment of Impact

*Give your judgment about how likely the abuse is, how damaging it would be when it happens, and how hard it would be to recover. For example:*

>I think many verifiers would accept only well known issuers, which would make this abuse impossible. However, maybe in 1-5% of cases, verifiers might be more flexible, which would make them vulnerable. If the fraud succeeds, verifiers would end up accepting an assertion from a party that's not worthy of trust (e.g., a diploma mill asserting that someone graduated). This would undermine the verifier's goals. Recovery would involve checking secondary references.

### Suggestions and further comments 

*What do you recommend, either to prevent or to detect the abuse? For example:*

>I suggest that we include an __escalation-URI__ field in the presentation message, so a verifier who doesn't recognize the issuer knows where to go to get more information.
